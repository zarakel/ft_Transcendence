# ft_Transcendence
Project ending the Common Core of 42, we realised with @Loan-Matarise, @andrew19, @kcatrix and myself a website having chat functionnalities, an online light game using the API of our school for the datas. The stack used here was React for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end. Both using typescript.
